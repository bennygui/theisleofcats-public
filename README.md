This is the implementation of The Isle of Cats for BGA:
https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=theisleofcats

This is a copy of the original private repository, stripped of images to
prevent any copyright problems. I will try to update it when the main
repository changes.

This is my second game on BGA. It is a bit more organised than my first game
but it relies a bit too much on the client side and duplicates a lot of logic
on the client side, especially to validate placing shapes on the boats.

This matches version 220408-1825 on BGA.
